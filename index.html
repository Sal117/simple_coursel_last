Relationary Carousel Page Documentation
===============================================================

Overview:
---------
This HTML document implements a responsive carousel for the Relationary website.
The carousel displays a series of service "slides" that each include an image, a brief
introduction, and a detailed view with additional information. Users can navigate the
carousel using arrow buttons, mouse wheel scrolling, or by clicking the dot indicators.
A "SEE MORE" button on each slide expands that slide to reveal more details along with
a "Book Now!" button.

File Structure:
---------------
1. HEAD Section:
   - Links to external stylesheets:
     • style.css      - Primary styles for layout, typography, and desktop view.
     • mobile.css     - Additional styles to ensure proper responsiveness on mobile devices.

2. BODY Section:
   - HEADER:
     • Contains the website logo and a simple navigation menu with links (Home, Info, Contact).

   - Carousel Container (<div class="carousel" id="carousel">):
     • This is the main wrapper for the carousel functionality.
     • Inside it, there is a <div class="list"> element that holds all the individual slide items.

   - Slide Items (<div class="item">):
     • Each slide represents a service offering and is structured as follows:
       - An <img> tag displaying a representative image.
       - A <div class="introduce"> block containing:
           • <div class="title">   - The main title or headline.
           • <div class="topic">   - A secondary title or topic.
           • <div class="des">     - A short general description.
           • A button with class "seeMore" that, when clicked, opens the detailed view.
       - A <div class="detail"> block (initially hidden) that contains:
           • A title and expanded description.
           • A <div class="features"> block with a table that lists key features or service details.
           • A <div class="checkout"> block with a "Book Now!" button.

   - Carousel Navigation Elements:
     • <div class="arrows"> contains three buttons:
         - Button with id "prev" for navigating to the previous slide.
         - Button with id "next" for navigating to the next slide.
         - Button with id "back" for exiting the detail view (visible only when details are shown).
     • <div class="slide-indicators"> holds a series of <span class="dot"> elements that
       visually represent each slide and indicate which slide is currently active.
